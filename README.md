Brief Project Description: I tried to do a Dartmouth version of social media where there's info about students, their year, majors, what student organisations/clubs they're involved in and the idea is that other students can look students up through that. The Posts model is for people to post about things they're doing with different student clubs. Users can also find posts by clubs to get a real idea of what student orgs on campus are about. Posts also support likes and comments.
